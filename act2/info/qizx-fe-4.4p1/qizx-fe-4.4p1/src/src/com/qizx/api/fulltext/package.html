<p>This package represents a simple framework for extending and redefining  
full-text features. It is meant for advanced use.
<p>Redefining full-text features involves plugging a FullTextFactory implementation
 which creates or locates various full-text resources defined by the following interfaces:<ul>
<li>Interface TextTokenizer specifies an object that parses text chunks 
into "tokens" (a word is a particular kind of token). It is the only mandatory
feature created by a FullTextFactory.
<li>interface Stemmer is an object that extracts the "stem" of a word, allowing stemming
in full-text searches.
<li>interface Thesaurus defines a thesaurus driver, allowing
query words to be replaced by words or word sequences found in the thesaurus.
<li>interface Scorer is an abstraction of the scoring algorithm.
</ul>
